            How: Throughout your day, pause and notice what&apos;s happening in
            the present moment. This could be the sound of birds, the feeling of
            the breeze on your skin, or the taste of your food. Take a few
            moments to fully experience and appreciate it. Duration: 1-3 minutes
            per pause.
