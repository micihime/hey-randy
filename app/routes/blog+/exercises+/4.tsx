            How: Find a quiet place to walk slowly and intentionally. Focus on
            the sensations of your feet touching the ground, the movement of
            your legs, and the rhythm of your breathing. Be aware of your
            surroundings without getting distracted by them. Duration: 10-15
            minutes.
